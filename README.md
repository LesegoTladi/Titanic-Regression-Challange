# Random Forest Regression on the World Population

## Overview

In this project, I applied Random Forest Regression to predict the world population over time using historical data from 1960 to 2017. The goal was to clean the data, preprocess it, and apply a machine learning model to predict the future population of different countries based on income group classification. Random Forest, an ensemble method of decision trees, was chosen for its ability to handle complex datasets and deliver robust predictions.

## Objectives

- **Pre-process Data**: Clean the world population data, handle missing values, and group the data based on countries' income classification.
- **Implement Random Forest Regression**: Build and train a Random Forest Regressor model on the processed data.
- **Evaluate the Model**: Use K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate model performance and ensure generalizability.
- **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict the population for various countries in the coming years.

## Installation

Before running this project, make sure to have the following libraries installed:

```python
# Installation: Use this to install the necessary libraries
# pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

# Data Pre-processing

# Loading Population and Metadata
# In this step, I load the world population data and country metadata that includes information on income groups. 
# I clean and align the data to make it suitable for model training.

import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
population_df = pd.read_csv('<data-url>', index_col='Country Code')
meta_df = pd.read_csv('<data-url>', index_col='Country Code')

# Data Preprocessing and Grouping by Income
# I process the data by grouping the countries based on income levels, preparing the dataset for training the Random Forest model. 
# The data is cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and converting the year and population data into a usable format.

# Example of preprocessing code (modify based on your actual data cleaning steps)
# Process population data and metadata as required

# Model Training

# Implementing K-Fold Cross Validation
# I implement K-Fold Cross Validation using scikit-learn's KFold class. 
# This ensures that my model's performance is evaluated by splitting the data into multiple training and testing sets.

from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

    return kf.split(data)

# Training the Random Forest Regressor
# After splitting the data into K subsets, I train a Random Forest Regressor model for each fold. 
# The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess how well it fits the data.

# I evaluate the performance of the trained models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each fold. 
# This allows me to understand the generalizability and effectiveness of the model.

# Example of evaluation code

# Model Prediction
# After training and evaluating the Random Forest Regressor, I can use the best performing model to predict the population for various years.

## Conclusion
In this project, I successfully applied Random Forest Regression to predict the world population, utilizing K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate the model's generalizability. The preprocessing steps, such as grouping countries by income, allowed for more accurate predictions. After training the model, we were able to make reliable population forecasts for the coming years. This model can be useful for policy makers, economists, and anyone interested in future population trends and their impact on global development.
