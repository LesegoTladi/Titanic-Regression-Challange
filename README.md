# Random Forest Regression on the World Population

## Overview

In this project, I applied Random Forest Regression to predict the world population over time using historical data from 1960 to 2017. The goal was to clean the data, preprocess it, and apply a machine learning model to predict the future population of different countries based on income group classification. Random Forest, an ensemble method of decision trees, was chosen for its ability to handle complex datasets and deliver robust predictions.

## Objectives

- **Pre-process Data**: Clean the world population data, handle missing values, and group the data based on countries' income classification.
- **Implement Random Forest Regression**: Build and train a Random Forest Regressor model on the processed data.
- **Evaluate the Model**: Use K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate model performance and ensure generalizability.
- **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict the population for various countries in the coming years.

## Installation

Before running this project, make sure to have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Data Pre-processing
Loading Population and Metadata
In this step, we load the world population data and country metadata that includes information on income groups. We clean and align the data to make it suitable for model training.

import pandas as pd

population_df = pd.read_csv('<data-url>', index_col='Country Code')
meta_df = pd.read_csv('<data-url>', index_col='Country Code')

Data Preprocessing and Grouping by Income
We process the data by grouping the countries based on income levels, preparing the dataset for training the Random Forest model. The data is cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and converting the year and population data into a usable format.

Model Training
Implementing K-Fold Cross Validation
We implement K-Fold Cross Validation using scikit-learn's KFold class. This ensures that our model's performance is evaluated by splitting the data into multiple training and testing sets.

def sklearn_kfold_split(data, K):
    # Implement K-Fold split
    pass
Training the Random Forest Regressor
After splitting the data into K subsets, we train a Random Forest Regressor model for each fold. The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess how well it fits the data.

def best_k_model(data, data_indices):
    # Implement model training and evaluation
    pass
Evaluating Model Performance
We evaluate the performance of the trained models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each fold. This allows us to understand the generalizability and effectiveness of the model.

mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
Model Prediction
After training and evaluating the Random Forest Regressor, we can use the best performing model to predict the population for various years.


best_model.predict([[2025]])
Functions
sklearn_kfold_split
This function splits the dataset into K subsets, ensuring that the model is trained and tested on different subsets of the data.

def sklearn_kfold_split(data, K):
    """
    Splits the data into K subsets for cross-validation.
    
    Parameters:
    - data: pandas DataFrame
    - K: int, the number of folds for cross-validation
    
    Returns:
    - List of training and testing subsets
    """
    # K-Fold split implementation
    pass
best_k_model
This function trains a Random Forest Regressor on each K subset and evaluates its performance.

def best_k_model(data, data_indices):
    """
    Trains a Random Forest model using K-Fold cross-validation.
    
    Parameters:
    - data: pandas DataFrame
    - data_indices: List of indices for training and testing
    
    Returns:
    - Trained Random Forest model
    """
    # Random Forest training and evaluation implementation
    pass

Conclusion
In this project, I successfully applied Random Forest Regression to predict the world population, utilizing K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate the model's generalizability. The preprocessing steps, such as grouping countries by income, allowed for more accurate predictions. After training the model, we were able to make reliable population forecasts for the coming years. This model can be useful for policy makers, economists, and anyone interested in future population trends and their impact on global development.
